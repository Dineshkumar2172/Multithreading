    /*
     * Thread synchronization prevents multiple threads from accessing the same resource at the same time, avoiding race conditions and inconsistent data.
     * 
     * Why Do We Need Synchronization?
     *      Without synchronization:
     *          * Threads interfere with each other.
     *          * Data becomes inconsistent.
     *          * Unpredictable race conditions occur.
     *      Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
     *  
     * Ways to Synchronize in Java
     *      synchronized method	                   -   Locks the entire method, allowing only one thread at a time.
     *      synchronized block                     -   Locks only a specific block of code instead of the whole method.
     *      Lock (from java.util.concurrent.locks) - More flexible than synchronized, allowing tryLock() and unlocking manually.
     *      Atomic Variables                       - Special variables (AtomicInteger, AtomicLong) that handle synchronization internally.
