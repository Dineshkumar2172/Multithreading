     * Thread synchronization prevents multiple threads from accessing the same resource at the same time, avoiding race conditions and inconsistent data.
     * 
     * Why Do We Need Synchronization?
     *      Without synchronization:
     *          * Threads interfere with each other.
     *          * Data becomes inconsistent.
     *          * Unpredictable race conditions occur.
     *      Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
